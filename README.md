# pythonicbasicclass
A place to store the python scripts for my SLNCOnline students.
## Lists of my students:
* Destiny
* Serina
* Iseoluwa.
## What we are doing:
* Learning python
* learning git and GitHub
* Learning wxpython
* Learning data structures and algorithm.
## Right now:
* we are learning how to use git and GitHub, hence this repo.
* They want me to record the class.
### Please note:
This repo may or may not host any code, because they get to do all the coding, not me.

All I do, is teach and give assignment.
